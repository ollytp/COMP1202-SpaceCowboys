# COMP1202-SpaceCowboys

Challenge one notes:

Write a program which converts an email id into a name by
Constructing a BufferedReader object so that can read an email id from System.in (you will need some intermediate objects to help you here. Look it up!)
Constructing the full Web page address by string concatenation
Constructing a URL object from the Web address
Constructing a BufferedReader object that can read from the URL (you will need some intermediate objects to help you here. Look in the book!)
Ignoring the first lines of input from the Web page and saving the one which contains the name (Hint: <... property="name">)
Use the indexOf() and substring() methods to find and extract the name from the line
Print out the result

I decided to use Python for this challenge.
